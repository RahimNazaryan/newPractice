Whats Agile (Agile model / agile methodology /agile process) ?

it is an iterative and incremental approach.

Incremental nature ==> means we keep adding features in the software.
iterative ==> same kind of process we are repeating again and again.

EX: suppose customer has 100 features in his application we will implement 10 features and
deliver to customer


Agile Principles

1- customer no need to wait for long time 
2-we can accomidate changes from customer (changes are welcome)
3-we develope , test and release priece of software to the customer with some number 
of feature ( there will be good between developer tester and product owner )


Advantages and Disadvantages.

A1-requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or middile.
A2- release will be fast
A3- Customer no need to wait for long time
A4-Good Communication Between Team
A5-it is very easy model to adopt


D1- less focus on design and documintation since we deliver software very faster.


----------------------------============================
Scrum?
Scrum is a framework since agile is defined framework.

Scrum is framework through which we build the software following agile process

Scrum Team ( scrum includes a group of people which we called scrum team contains 5-9 people )

1-product owner:
2-scrum master
3-dev team
4-Qa team (tester)

Product Owner : defines the feature of the product writing the requirement
		prioritize features according to market value
		adjust features and priority every iteration as needed 
		Accept or rejrct work result

Scrum Master : 
		the main role is facilitating and driving the agile process
			he has ther knowledge of the entire scrume.

User Story - a feature / module in software

Epic : collection of user stories

Product backlog : contains list of user stories .prepeared by product owner 

Sprint/iteration : is a period time to complete the user stories decieded by the product owner and team, useually 2-4 week.

Sprint planing meeting : meeting conducts with the team to define what can be deliver in the sprint and duration.

Sprint Baacklog : list of commited stories by dev/qa for specific sprint ( these are the stories which are picked by dev /qa for specific sprint)

Scrum Meeting : every day team have meeting every for 15 min ( Standup meeting / scrum call)	
		what u did yesturday / will do today / any blockers 


Sprint Retrospective meeting ( this meeting will be conducting at the end of each sprint) everybody will be conducting the meeting 


Story Point - rough estimation of user stories will be given dev /qa in the form if fabinici searies
0 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

1 story point  = 1 hr / 1 day (6-8 hours ) it means depends on the company

Login --->  DEV - 5 QA - 3 ( totally 8 hours )

Burn Down Chart = its a graphical chart it shows that how much work has been done and reamining maintined by Scrum master.

1 story -- 3 days ( 18 hours )



Product owner takes all the requirement from stakeholder customer and put it the product backlog


Roles ( product owner , srum master , team)
Artefects ( product backlog, sprint backlog and burndown chart)
Cermonies( sprint planning, daily srum, sprint review)


Scrum Board ( we maintain this board day to do and updated )
