ARRAY ( is an object )

is the collection of homogeniues data type means similer data types 
each value has index posation inside arrays we can acces value using index value 

New = key word is using to create object 

Arrays super class is object class in occupy meomry in heap meomry 

Advantages : it can store muiltiple values 
	     arrays are fast as capare to permitive data types 

Disadvantages: fixed in size we can not increase and decrease in runtime.
	       wastage of meomry location
	       we can only store same data type.
